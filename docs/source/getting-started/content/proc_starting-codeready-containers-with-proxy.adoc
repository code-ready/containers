= Starting {prod} behind proxy

Proxy can be defined as part of environment variable or with `crc config set` command option as following:

```
$ crc config set http-proxy http://example.proxy.com:<port>
$ crc config set https-proxy http://example.proxy.com:<port>
$ crc config set no-proxy '<multiple-no-proxy-entries-with-comma-separated>'
```

Once proxy is set by environment variable or by config, `crc` commands will able to use it.


[NOTE]
====
- If both config and env are set for proxy, the values set in crc config have priority over the ones set in the environment.
- Make sure to export `.testing` as part of `no_proxy/NO_PROXY` environment variable before login to cluster using `oc` command
line on the host.
