= Understanding {prod}

{rh-prod} brings a minimal OpenShift 4.0 or newer cluster to your local computer.

{prod} includes the [command]`{bin}` command-line interface (CLI) to interact with the {prod} virtual machine running the OpenShift cluster.

= Differences with a production OpenShift install

{rh-prod} is a regular OpenShift installation with the following notable differences:

* It uses a single node which behaves both as a master and as a worker node.
* The `machine-config`, `marketplace` and `monitoring` Operators are disabled by default.
* These disabled Operators will cause the corresponding parts of the web console to be non functional.
* The OpenShift instance is running in a virtual machine, which could cause some other differences, in particular in relation with external networking.
