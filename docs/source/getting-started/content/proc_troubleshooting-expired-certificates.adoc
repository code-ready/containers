= Troubleshooting expired certificates

Each released `{bin}` binary includes an embedded system bundle that expires 30 days after the release due to certificates embedded in the OpenShift cluster.
Using an older `{bin}` binary or system bundle will result in an expired certificates error.

.Procedure

To resolve expired certificate errors:

. link:{crc-download-url}[Download the latest {prod} release] and place the `{bin}` binary in your `$PATH`.

. Remove the cluster with certificate errors using the [command]`{bin} delete` command:
+
[subs="+quotes,attributes"]
----
$ {bin} delete
----
+
[NOTE]
====
The [command]`{bin} delete` command will result in the loss of data stored in the {prod} virtual machine.
====

. Set up the new release:
+
[subs="+quotes,attributes"]
----
$ {bin} setup
----

. Start the new cluster:
+
[subs="+quotes,attributes"]
----
$ {bin} start
----
