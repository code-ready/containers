= Troubleshooting bundle version mismatch

As {prod} releases are setup and started, instances are created with bundle information 
and instance data.  When a new {prod} release is setup, the bundle information and instance data
is not updated due to the customization in the previous instance data.  This will lead to errors on 
[command]`{bin} start` command
