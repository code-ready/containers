= Starting Monitoring, Alerting, and Telemetry

To make sure {prod} can run on a typical laptop, some resource-heavy services get disabled by default.
One of these is Prometheus and the related monitoring, alerting, and telemetry functionality.
Telemetry functionality is responsible for listing your cluster in the link:https://cloud.redhat.com/openshift[Red Hat OpenShift Cluster Manager].

.Prerequisites

* A running {prod} virtual machine and a working [command]`oc` command.
For more information, see <<accessing-the-openshift-cluster-with-oc_{context}>>.
* You must assign additional memory to the {prod} virtual machine.
At least 12 GiB of memory (a value of `12288`) is recommended.
For more information, see <<configuring-the-virtual-machine_{context}>>.

.Procedure

. Start monitoring, alerting, and telemetry services:
