= Understanding {prod}

{rh-prod} brings a minimal OpenShift 4 cluster to your local computer.
This cluster provides a minimal environment for development and testing purposes.
It's mainly targetted at running on developers' desktops.
For other use cases, such as headless, multi-developer or team-based setups, use of the link:https://cloud.redhat.com/openshift/install/[full-fledged OpenShift installer] is recommended.

You can refer to the link:https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/latest/welcome/index.html#developer-activities[OpenShift documentation] for a more in-depth introduction to OpenShift.

{prod} includes the [command]`{bin}` command-line interface (CLI) to interact with the {prod} virtual machine running the OpenShift cluster.
