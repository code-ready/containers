On Linux, {prod} expects the following DNS configuration:

* {prod} expects NetworkManager to manage networking.
* NetworkManager uses `dnsmasq` via the [filename]`/etc/NetworkManager/conf.d/crc-nm-dnsmasq.conf` configuration file.
* The configuration file for this `dnsmasq` instance is [filename]`/etc/NetworkManager/dnsmasq.d/crc.conf`:

server=/crc.testing/192.168.130.11
server=/apps-crc.testing/192.168.130.11
----
** The NetworkManager `dnsmasq` instance forwards requests for the `crc.testing` and `apps-crc.testing` domains to the `192.168.130.11` DNS server.
This DNS server is a `dnsmasq` instance running inside of the virtual machine.

[id="dns-configuration-mac_{context}"]
== {mac}

On {mac}, {prod} expects the following DNS configuration:

* {prod} creates a [filename]`/etc/resolver/testing` file which instructs {mac} to forward all DNS requests  for the `testing` domain to the {prod} virtual machine.
* {prod} also adds an `api.crc.testing` entry to [filename]`/etc/hosts` pointing at the VM IP address.
The [command]`oc` binary requires this entry.
