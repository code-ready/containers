= Differences from a production OpenShift install

{rh-prod} is a regular OpenShift installation with the following notable differences:

* It uses a single node which behaves both as a master and as a worker node.
* The `machine-config` and `monitoring` Operators are disabled by default.
* These disabled Operators will cause the corresponding parts of the web console to be non functional.
* For the same reason, there is currently no upgrade path to newer OpenShift versions.
* Due to technical limitations, the {prod} cluster is ephemeral and will need to be recreated from scratch once a month using a newer release.
* The OpenShift instance is running in a virtual machine, which could cause some other differences, in particular in relation with external networking.
