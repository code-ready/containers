= Setting up {prod}

The [command]`{bin} setup` command performs operations to set up the environment of your host machine for the {prod} virtual machine.

This procedure will create the [filename]`~/.crc` directory if it does not already exist.

Always run the [command]`{bin}` executable with your user account.
* If you are setting up a new version, capture any changes made to the virtual machine before setting up a new {prod} release.
