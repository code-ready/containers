= Reserved IP subnets

The {prod} OpenShift cluster reserves IP subnets for internal use which should not collide with your host network.
Ensure that the following IP subnets are available for use:

.Reserved IP subnets
* `10.217.0.0/22`
* `10.217.4.0/23`
* `192.168.126.0/24`

Additionally, each host hypervisor reserves an additional IP subnet depending on the host operating system.
On {msw}, the hypervisor reserves a randomly generated IP subnet that cannot be determined ahead-of-time.
The reserved subnets for Linux and {mac} are as follows:

Linux:: `192.168.130.0/24`
{mac}:: `192.168.64.0/24`
