= Developing CodeReady Containers

[[developing-overview]]
== Overview

The following sections describe how to build and test the project.

[[develop-prerequisites]]
== Prerequisites

- Git
- Make
- A recent Go distribution (>=1.11)

[NOTE]
====
You should be able to develop the project on Linux, Windows, or macOS.
====

[[set-up-dev-env]]
== Setting up the development environment

[[cloning-repository]]
=== Cloning the repository

Get the sources from GitHub:

----
$ git clone https://github.com/code-ready/crc.git
----

[NOTE]
====
Do not keep the source code in your `$GOPATH`, as link:https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/Modules[Go modules] will cause `make` to fail.
====

[[dependency-management]]
== Dependency management

CodeReady Containers uses link:https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/Modules[Go modules] for dependency management.

For more information, see the following:

[[running-integration-tests]]
== Running integration tests

We have automated integration tests which keep CodeReady Containers in shape.

[[intro-to-integration-testing]]
=== Introduction
Integration tests use the link:http://github.com/code-ready/clicumber[Clicumber] package to provide basic functionality for testing CLI binaries.

Clicumber allows running commands in a persistent shell instance (`bash`, `tcsh`, `zsh`, Command Prompt, or PowerShell), assert its outputs (standard output, standard error, or exit code), check configuration files, and so on. The general functionality of Clicumber is then extended by CodeReady Containers specific test code to cover the whole functionality of CodeReady Containers.

[[how-to-run-integration-tests]]
=== How to run

First, one needs to set the following flags in `Makefile`, under `integration` target:

- `--pull-secret-file`: absolute path to your OpenShift pull secret.
- `--bundle-location`: if bundle is embedded, this flag should be set to `--bundle-location=embedded` or not passed at all; if bundle is not embedded, then absolute path to the bundle should be passed.
- `--crc-binary`: if `crc` binary resides in `$GOPATH/bin`, then this flag needs not be passed; otherwise absolute path to the `crc` binary should be passed.

To start integration tests, run:
```bash
$ make integration
```

===== How to run only a subset of all integration tests

Implicitly, all integration tests for your operating system are executed. If you want to run only tests from one feature file, you have to override `GODOG_OPTS` environment variable. For example:

```bash
make integration GODOG_OPTS="--godog.tags='@basic && @windows'" BUNDLE_LOCATION=<bundle location> PULL_SECRET_FILE=<pull secret path>
```

Please notice `@basic && @windows`, where `@basic` tag stands for `basic.feature` file and `@windows` tag for integration tests designed for Windows.

[[how-to-test-cert-rotation]]
=== How to test cert rotation

On linux platform first stop the network time sync using:
```
$ sudo timedatectl set-ntp off
```

Set the time 2 month ahead:
```
$ sudo date -s '2 month'
```

Start the crc with `CRC_DEBUG_ENABLE_STOP_NTP=true` set:
```
$ CRC_DEBUG_ENABLE_STOP_NTP=true crc start
```
