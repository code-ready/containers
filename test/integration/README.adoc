[[intro-to-integration-testing]]
== Introduction
Integration tests use the link:http://github.com/code-ready/clicumber[Clicumber] package to provide basic functionality for testing CLI binaries.

Clicumber allows running commands in a persistent shell instance (`bash`, `tcsh`, `zsh`, Command Prompt, or PowerShell), assert its outputs (standard output, standard error, or exit code), check configuration files, and so on. The general functionality of Clicumber is then extended by CodeReady Containers specific test code to cover the whole functionality of CodeReady Containers.

[[how-to-run-integration-tests]]
== How to run

To start integration tests, run:

```bash
$ make integration BUNDLE_LOCATION=<bundle location> PULL_SECRET_FILE=<pull secret path>
```
where `<bundle location>` is either the bundle's URL or its path in the filesystem,
and `<pull secret path>` is the path to a file containing your OpenShift pull secret.
The paths must be absolute paths.
